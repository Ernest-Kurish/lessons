        <p class="main-text">
          HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, has come a long way since its
          inception in the late 1990s. Since the year 2000, there have been
          several significant advancements in the way HTML is used to create
          dynamic web pages. In this post, we will take a look at some of the
          most significant developments in HTML dynamic development since 2000.
          HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language
          used to create web pages. As technology continues to evolve, so too
          does HTML.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
          One of the key trends in the future of HTML is the increased use of
          semantic tags, such as <mark>&lt;header&gt;</mark>,
          <mark>&lt;main&gt;</mark>, and <mark>&lt;footer&gt;</mark>, to improve
          the accessibility and searchability of web pages.
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
          The introduction of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) in 2005
          also played a significant role in HTML dynamic development since 2000.
          AJAX allows for the creation of web pages that can update their
          content without having to refresh the entire page. This technology is
          used for creating Single Page Applications (SPAs) where the web pages
          feel like native applications. Finally, the development of frameworks
          and libraries such as AngularJS, ReactJS and VueJS have made it easier
          for developers to create dynamic web pages. These frameworks and
          libraries provide pre-built components and functions that can be
          easily integrated into web pages, making it quicker and easier to
          create dynamic web pages. In conclusion, HTML dynamic development has
          come a long way since 2000. With the introduction of HTML5, increased
          use of JavaScript and CSS, the introduction of AJAX, and the
          development of frameworks and libraries, it is now easier than ever to
          create dynamic web pages that are interactive, responsive, and fast.
          HTML has become more powerful, sophisticated, and dynamic than ever
          before, and we can expect to see even more advancements in the future.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <mark>&lt;section&gt;</mark> - for grouping related content
            together.
          </li>
          <li><mark>&lt;nav&gt;</mark> - for navigation links.</li>
          <li>
            <mark>&lt;article&gt;</mark> - for self-contained content, such as a
            blog post.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="atributes">New Attributes</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><span>id</span> - a unique identifier for a specific element.</li>
          <li>
            <span>class</span> - a way to group elements together for styling or
            scripting.
          </li>
          <li><span>data-*</span> - for adding custom data to an element.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="main-text">
          Another significant development in HTML dynamic development since 2000
          is the increased use of JavaScript and CSS. JavaScript is a
          programming language that is often used in conjunction with HTML to
          create dynamic web pages. It allows for the creation of interactive
          elements such as drop-down menus, pop-ups, and image sliders.
          Similarly, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the layout
          and design of web pages. It allows for the creation of responsive
          designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
