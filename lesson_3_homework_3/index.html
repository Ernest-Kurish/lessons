        <h2 id="history">The History of Skiing in Japan</h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          Skiing has a long history in Japan, dating back to the early 20th
          century. The first ski resort in Japan was established in the town of
          Akakura in 1912. The sport grew in popularity during the 1930s, and
          the Japanese ski team even competed in the 1936 Winter Olympics held
          in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. After World War II, skiing in
          Japan experienced a boom in popularity. The Japanese government began
          promoting skiing as a recreational activity to boost tourism in the
          country. Many new ski resorts were built, and the sport became more
          accessible to the general public.

      <div class="section-culture">
        <h2 id="culture">The Culture of Skiing in Japan</h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          Skiing is not just a sport in Japan, it is a cultural phenomenon.
          Skiing has become an integral part of Japanese culture, and the
          country has developed a unique ski culture that is different from
          anywhere else in the world. One aspect of Japanese ski culture is the
          onsen, or hot spring. Many ski resorts in Japan have hot springs
          nearby, and it is common for skiers to take a dip in the hot springs
          after a long day on the slopes. The hot springs are believed to have
          therapeutic properties and are a great way to relax and rejuvenate
          after a day of skiing. Another aspect of Japanese ski culture is the
          food. Japan is known for its amazing cuisine, and ski resorts are no
          exception. Skiers can enjoy traditional Japanese dishes like ramen and
          udon noodles, as well as hot pot dishes like shabu-shabu and sukiyaki.
          Finally, Japanese ski culture is characterized by its emphasis on
          safety and respect for others. Skiers in Japan are expected to follow
          strict rules and etiquette, such as not skiing outside of designated
          areas and not cutting in line. Safety is a top priority, and skiers
          are expected to wear helmets and follow the rules of the resort.
