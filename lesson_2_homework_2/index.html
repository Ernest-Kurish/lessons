		<h1 class="main-title">Hypertext Markup Language</h1>
		<p class="main-text">HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, has come a long way since its inception in the late 1990s. Since the year 2000,
		there have been several significant advancements in the way HTML is used to create dynamic web pages. In this post, we
		will take a look at some of the most significant developments in HTML dynamic development since 2000. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. As
			technology continues to evolve, so too does HTML.</p>
		<p class="main-text">One of the key trends in the future of HTML is the increased use of semantic tags, such as
			<mark>&lt;header&gt;</mark>, <mark>&lt;main&gt;</mark>, and <mark>&lt;footer&gt;</mark>, to improve the
			accessibility and searchability of web pages.</p>

		<p class="main-text">The introduction of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) in 2005 also played a significant role in HTML dynamic
			development since 2000. AJAX allows for the creation of web pages that can update their content without having to
			refresh the entire page. This technology is used for creating Single Page Applications (SPAs) where the web pages feel
			like native applications.
			
			Finally, the development of frameworks and libraries such as AngularJS, ReactJS and VueJS have made it easier for
			developers to create dynamic web pages. These frameworks and libraries provide pre-built components and functions that
			can be easily integrated into web pages, making it quicker and easier to create dynamic web pages.
			
			In conclusion, HTML dynamic development has come a long way since 2000. With the introduction of HTML5, increased use of
			JavaScript and CSS, the introduction of AJAX, and the development of frameworks and libraries, it is now easier than
			ever to create dynamic web pages that are interactive, responsive, and fast. HTML has become more powerful,
			sophisticated, and dynamic than ever before, and we can expect to see even more advancements in the future.

		<h2 id="tags">New tags</h2>
		<p class="main-text"></p>
		<ul>
			<li><mark>&lt;section&gt;</mark> - for grouping related content together.</li>
			<li><mark>&lt;nav&gt;</mark> - for navigation links.</li>
			<li><mark>&lt;article&gt;</mark> - for self-contained content, such as a blog post.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2 id="atributes">New Attributes</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><span>id</span> - a unique identifier for a specific element.</li>
			<li><span>class</span> - a way to group elements together for styling or scripting.</li>
			<li><span>data-*</span> - for adding custom data to an element.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="main-text">Another significant development in HTML dynamic development since 2000 is the increased use of JavaScript and CSS.
		JavaScript is a programming language that is often used in conjunction with HTML to create dynamic web pages. It allows
		for the creation of interactive elements such as drop-down menus, pop-ups, and image sliders. Similarly, CSS (Cascading
		Style Sheets) is used to control the layout and design of web pages. It allows for the creation of responsive designs
		that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.</p>
